# underover1point5

Basic idea is to identify matches where the odds are heavily stacked in one faour, e.g. top of the league vs bottom and then bet on the over/under goals market, standard bet being over 1.5 goals in favour of the higher ranked team. 

Various attributes other than league position would feed into the decision making process:

* Goals for
* Goals against
* Recent form
* Past meetings
