# underover1point5

Basic idea is to identify matches where the odds are heavily stacked in one faour, e.g. top of the league vs bottom and then bet on the over/under goals market, standard bet being over 1.5 goals in favour of the higher ranked team. 

Various attributes other than league position would feed into the decision making process:

* Goals for
* Goals against
* Recent form
* Past meetings
* Home or Away

The aim is to identify games with a high percentage chance of coming in.

## How Under Over Betting Works

A bookmaker offers odds on a selection of possible final goal totals for a match. As a punter, you predict whether the number of goals scored during the match will be less or more than a total set by the bookmaker.

### What does under 1.5 goals mean?

Under 1.5 goals betting is a bet on a match producing a single goal or no goal at all. A bet on under 1.5 goals is usually used when two evenly matched teams with strong defences or weaker attacks play each other, and you expect the match to result in a goalless draw or one team to win by scoring a single goal.

### What does over 1.5 goals mean?

Over 1.5 goals betting is a bet on a match producing 2 or more goals. When you bet on over 1.5 goals you are betting on a match producing at least 2 goals, which is a statistically likely outcome that will usually pay out at under Evens.
